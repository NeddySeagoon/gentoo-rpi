# gentoo-rpi
Gentoo Ebuilds for Raspberry Pi Ahead of the Gentoo Repository. 

Here be ebuilds for arm64 for things in the ::gentoo repo that are out of date.
That does not always mean that they are current, just newer than the ::gentoo repo.

There are mostly but not always, open bugs for the things here.

This repo exists to make it easy for me to keep my Pis in sync.

Only arm64 is tested. That's what I use.
If arm (32 bit) works, that's luck. Well the binary things are tested by upstream and indirectly by millions of users worldwide.

Do no file bugs for ebuilds here as they are not officially supported.
